#### Step by step

- We start by initializing an empty dictionary last_seen to keep track of the last position where each digram is seen.
- We also initialize a variable max_distance to -1 to store the maximum distance between identical digrams that we find.
- We loop over all possible digrams in the string by iterating from 0 to len(S)-1.
- For each digram, we check if it has been seen before by checking if it is in last_seen.
- If the digram is in last_seen, we calculate the distance between the current position and the last-seen position of the digram, and update max_distance if this distance is greater than the current value of max_distance.
- Whether or not the digram has been seen before, we update the last_seen dictionary with the current position of the digram.
- Finally, we return max_distance, which will hold the maximum distance between identical digrams in the string.

#### Performance

Complexity of the function is O(N), where N is the length of the string S. This is because the function loops over each digram in the string once, and the operations inside the loop (dict lookups, arithmetic, and comparisons) are all constant-time operations.
